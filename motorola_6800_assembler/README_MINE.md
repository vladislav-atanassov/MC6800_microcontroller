The assembler that I am using here is not mine. It is publicly posted at: https://github.com/JimInCA/motorola-6800-assembler

Things that I found when using the assembler and you to not do:
    - names can't be longer than 16 chars
    - you can't write commnets on a line that has a label
    - the comments can't be tabulated if they they are the only text on the line
